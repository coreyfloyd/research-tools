# Quick Research

Inline research for non-dev questions: check configured local knowledge first, then Reddit plus domain-appropriate authoritative sources, and synthesize in the conversation. No notebooks, no files written.

Read `~/.config/research-tools/profile.md` before checking local knowledge; use only the local-preflight policy it provides. This skill remains an inline response.

If a supplied audio or video source is needed as evidence, invoke `transcribe` to acquire its text first. The transcript is input evidence; the response stays inline.

Firecrawl is a runtime-detected optional integration. Prefer it for web search and page extraction. When it is unavailable or blocked for a source, use native web tools and say so in the response; do not silently reduce source coverage.

## When NOT to Use

- Code, bugs, library questions → `research-dev`
- Deep research needing persistent notebooks and a durable artifact → `research-topic`
- Community sentiment for an adopt/buy/wait decision → `research-feedback`

## Phase 0 — Check local knowledge

If the local profile defines a knowledge preflight, run it before web search. Surface useful matches and ask whether to use them before searching externally. Without a profile, proceed directly to source planning.

## Phase 1 — Source Planning

### Domain Classification (infer from query, don't ask)

| Domain | Signals in query | Sources to add |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Product/gear** | "should I buy", "best X", "X vs Y", "worth it", "review" | Wirecutter, RTINGS, Ars Technica, YouTube reviews |
| **Place/travel** | city name, "visit", "trip", "restaurant", "hotel", "neighborhood" | TripAdvisor, Atlas Obscura, local subreddits |
| **Health/wellness** | symptom, medication, diet, supplement, "is X safe" | Mayo Clinic, Examine.com, NIH/PubMed (via search) |
| **Finance/money** | investing, savings, budget, mortgage, tax, crypto | Investopedia, NerdWallet, Bogleheads |
| **Current events** | recent dates, news topics, "what happened with" | Google News via Firecrawl, AP, Reuters |
| **Concept/topic** | "what is", "how does", "explain", abstract nouns | Wikipedia, relevant subreddits |
| **Service/company** | brand name, app name, subscription, "is X legit" | Trustpilot, BBB, Reddit |
| **General/unclear** | anything else | Wikipedia + 2 Firecrawl web searches |

If the domain is genuinely ambiguous and the wrong source set would waste the search, ask one short question up front: "What kind of angle are you looking for — [option A] or [option B]?" Then go.

## Phase 2 — Firecrawl Research

Run all searches in parallel.

1. **Reddit** (always): `firecrawl_search("site:reddit.com <query>")` — pick the 3 most relevant threads
2. **Domain source 1**: first authoritative source from the table above
3. **Domain source 2** (if warranted): second source or a broader Firecrawl web search
4. **Read full Reddit threads**: for the 2-3 most relevant threads, run the helper:
   ```bash
   ./reddit-read.sh "<thread-url>"
   ```
   Reddit blocks programmatic scrapers, but serves the real page to the user's logged-in Safari. The helper loads each thread in Safari in the background (no focus steal), extracts the rendered text, and closes its own tab. It requires an interactive macOS session with Safari signed into Reddit; when that is unavailable, check the profile's local policy for a blocked-channel route (for example, delegating the Reddit read to another agent runtime with access) before relying on search-result snippets, and note whichever coverage you ended up with. Scrape non-Reddit sources with `firecrawl_scrape` as normal.
5. Call `firecrawl_search_feedback` with the search ID after each search to refund a credit

## Output Format

Deliver inline in the conversation. No files, no notebooks.

```
**[Topic]** — [2-sentence synthesis of the overall picture]

**What people say (Reddit)**
- [Finding] — [r/subreddit thread title](url)
- [Finding] — [r/subreddit thread title](url)

**Key findings**
- [Point] ([Source](url))
- [Conflicting view or caveat if any] ([Source](url))

**Bottom line**: [1-sentence recommendation or verdict, if the question calls for one]
```

If sources agree, consolidate rather than repeating the same finding with multiple URLs. If they conflict, surface the conflict explicitly. Skip sections that don't apply.

If a local profile defines a checklist-time knowledge-capture policy, that policy may review this research later; this skill itself writes nothing.
