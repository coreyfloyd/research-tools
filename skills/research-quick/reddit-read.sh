# Read a Reddit thread's full rendered text (post + comments) WITHOUT the
# programmatic-scrape blocks that hit Firecrawl/curl/WebFetch, and WITHOUT
# stealing window focus.
#
# How it works: Reddit serves the real page to a normal human-loaded browser
# tab but blocks bots/automation. `open -g` loads the URL in the user's already-
# logged-in Safari *in the background* (-g = do not foreground the app), then
# Safari's native AppleScript `text of document` property extracts the rendered
# text. The tab we opened is closed afterward, so it reads invisibly and leaves
# no tab litter. Requires: macOS, Safari, user signed into Reddit in Safari.
#
# Prints cleaned thread text to stdout. Canonical home: research-quick skill;
# also used by research-feedback.
