# Research Topic

Conduct topic-first research with NotebookLM as the persistent source and synthesis layer. Use `research-sources` instead when the caller already supplies the evidence or asks to improve a named collection.

Before choosing sources, a durable output location, or local follow-up policy, validate `~/.config/research-tools/profile.md` with `../../scripts/validate_profile.py`, resolved relative to this skill. If it is missing or invalid, stop and use `research-tools-set-up`; do not choose a fallback output path. Any proposed follow-up task in the artifact uses `artifact_followup_destination`, never the wiki-maintenance route.

## Scope and source set

1. Establish the research question, decision it informs, and material constraints. Ask for caller-held sources before discovery; they take priority.
2. Check for a related NotebookLM notebook. Ask before adding to an existing notebook; otherwise create one and preserve its ID.
3. Firecrawl is a runtime-detected optional integration. Use it first, when available, for discovery and complete-page extraction. Use native web tools for sources it cannot reach and record that fallback.
4. Add user-provided and discovered sources to NotebookLM, retaining original URLs or paths. Invoke `transcribe` for material audio or video; prefer native YouTube indexing when it suffices.
5. Wait until sources are indexed before synthesis.

## Analyze and improve evidence

Query the notebook for key findings, source agreement, contradictions, evidence gaps, and support for each actionable claim. Classify claims as verified, unverified, contradicted, or overstated.

When evidence is incomplete, identify the specific gap and add the smallest useful set of sources. Use [the evidence-improvement procedure](../research-sources/references/improve-evidence.md) for source discovery and categorization. Re-run synthesis and claim verification after adding sources.

Prefer primary sources. Distinguish source-grounded findings from reasonable inference, disagreements, and open questions.

## Artifact

Write one durable artifact using [the shared research artifact contract](../research-absorb/references/artifact-contract.md). It must include the research question, source inventory and notebook ID, findings, claim verification, contradictions, gaps, and a **Decisions** section with its execution appendix.

Optional NotebookLM outputs such as reports, tables, or mind maps support the artifact; do not substitute them for it. Store generated files only in canonical `output/`, not scratch.

At completion, report the artifact path and its proposed plan. The caller may invoke `research-absorb`; do not automatically distribute, promote, or archive the artifact.

## Boundaries

- `research-quick` and `research-dev` remain inline research paths.
- `research-feature` covers competitor UX and established patterns.
- `research-feedback` covers lived community experience.
- This skill does not execute a distribution plan or sweep uncompiled knowledge.
