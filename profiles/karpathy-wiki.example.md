## Optional local policy

This body is intentionally free-form and remains outside the public package.
Use it for personal taxonomy, source-library routing, output conventions,
knowledge-base operation rules, and blocked-channel routes — alternate
retrieval paths for channels the primary runtime cannot reach (for example,
"Reddit: delegate the read to <agent runtime with access>", or "browser
route: <the user's chosen browser and mechanism>" — the bundled Safari
helper is one implementation; a runtime's browser-automation tool or another
browser's scripting interface are equally valid), which the research skills
consult before accepting reduced coverage. Skills that read the profile read this
free-form local policy body after the validated YAML frontmatter. The required
frontmatter fields configure the portable session cache, operation log,
decision log, and two independent follow-up destinations; use this body to
define their local shape.
